This work was started three weeks ago from the beggining of oct 2025. 
I had some issues displaying the code on Git, and some files became invalid due to version mismatches. 
I tried to fix it using VS Code, but it didnâ€™t work, so I pulled the files again with the .py extension. Please open these files.
